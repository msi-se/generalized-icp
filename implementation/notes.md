- implementation of time measuring of the (g)icp align as time_alignment topic
- cparameterization of node to handle gicp and icp in one node
    - exactly the same code = same overall conditions
    - Less customization
- creation of yaml files with parameters
- implementation of gicp node
- see which map contains what and how they differ
- count of iterations until converged not possible
