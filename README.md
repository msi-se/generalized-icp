# Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP)

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP) algorithm, a probabilistic scan-matching algorithm used for estimating the transformation between two point clouds. The project includes a static visualization of the algorithm's output, as well as a small robot simulator for testing the algorithm in a dynamic environment.
